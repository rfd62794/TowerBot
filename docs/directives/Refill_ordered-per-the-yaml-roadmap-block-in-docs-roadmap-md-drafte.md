# Ordered per the yaml roadmap block in docs/ROADMAP.md (drafted 2026-09-22):

Drafted by the queue's refill pass from `docs/DIRECTION.md` - a starting point for
a human to scope, not a ready dispatch.

## Why this exists

The repo's direction doc names a next step and `docs/directives/` has no active
item, so the queue drafted this stub to hold the place. A scoping agent expands
it from the direction doc and the repo's own state before it is ever queued.

## The work

Read `docs/DIRECTION.md` (especially `## Next steps`) and the repo's current
state, then expand this stub into a scoped directive: what to change, the rules
for the run, and completion criteria a command can check.

## Completion criteria

- [ ] This stub is expanded into a scoped directive, or reported as a false positive.

## Verification

`uv run agentflow lint --new-only` exits 0 for this file - the expanded directive must add no new lint findings.
